GraphETM is a graph-embedded topic model for analyzing scRNA-seq data using prior biological knowledge.
It integrates gene expression data with gene-gene interaction graphs to uncover biologically meaningful latent topics.
Currently applied to PBMC data, GraphETM identifies immune-relevant processes and gene clusters through graph-guided embeddings and topic modeling.
